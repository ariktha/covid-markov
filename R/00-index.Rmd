# Overview {-}

This analysis examines model structures COVID-19 patient trajectories using multi-state Markov models. The analysis is structured in several stages:

1. Data Processing
    - Filtering encounters
    - Processing raw data files
    - Creating patient staging data
    
2. Model Development
    - Base model fitting
    - Testing Markov assumptions
    - Covariate selection

## Model Configurations

The analysis considers four model structures:

- 4-state model: M, S, R, D (Moderate, Severe, Recovered, Dead)
- 5-state model: M, MS, S, R, D (adds Moderate with history of Severe)
- 6-state model: M1, M2, MS, S, R, D (splits Moderate into two stages)
- 7-state model: M1, M2, M3, MS, S, R, D (splits Moderate into three stages)
